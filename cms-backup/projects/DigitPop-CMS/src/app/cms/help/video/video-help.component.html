            Upload a video that showcases your products.  Shoppable Video is capable of
            showcasing multiple products at a time. Take the classic fashion
            show format for example. Each model has a look that is composed of
            multiple products working in concert. It is suggested that all the
            products are displayed for enough time for the viewer to properly
            evaluate the product.  A steady rhythm, for example of five to ten seconds
            per product group is suggested.  Any editing of the video should be done before
            this step.
